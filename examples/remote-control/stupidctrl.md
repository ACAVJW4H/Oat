### Stupidctrl

__`oat-record`__ provides an interface for remote recording control using the
`--rpc-endpoint` option. This allows another program, either running on the
same machine as Oat or elsewhere to control when recording starts, pauses,
stops, or creates a new file. I developed a simple GUI so that I can use this
feature to synchronize Oat recordings with other devices I'm using in the lab.
